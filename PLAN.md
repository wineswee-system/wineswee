## Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka Future-Ready)

The system is built on a **pluggable event-driven architecture** designed for seamless Kafka migration when scale demands it. The current in-memory transport can be swapped for Kafka by changing a single line — no handler, middleware, or business logic changes required.

### Current Architecture (Phase 1 — In-Memory)

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Publisher   │────▶│    EventBus       │────▶│  InMemoryTransport│
│  (any page)  │     │  ┌─────────────┐ │     │  (synchronous)   │
│              │     │  │ Middleware   │ │     └────────┬─────────┘
│ bus.publish( │     │  │ 1.Tenant    │ │              │
│  'wms.ship', │     │  │ 2.Idempotent│ │     ┌────────▼─────────┐
│  payload     │     │  │ 3.Validator │ │     │   Subscribers    │
│ )            │     │  │ 4.AuditLog  │ │     │  (domain handlers)│
└─────────────┘     │  │ 5.DLQ       │ │     └──────────────────┘
                    │  └─────────────┘ │
                    └──────────────────┘
```

### Kafka Migration (Phase 2 — One-Line Swap)

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐

```

### What's Built (Kafka-Ready Infrastructure)

| Component | Location | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **EventBus core** | `src/lib/events/EventBus.js` | Done — pluggable transport interface |
| **Event catalog** (8 domains) | `src/lib/events/catalog/` | Done — schema validation per event type |
| **Middleware chain** (5 layers) | `src/lib/events/middleware/` | Done |
| ├ Tenant context | `middleware/tenantContext.js` | Injects tenant_id for multi-tenant partitioning |
| ├ Idempotency | `middleware/idempotency.js` | Deduplicates events (critical for Kafka at-least-once) |
| ├ Schema validator | `middleware/validator.js` | Validates payload against catalog |
| ├ Audit logger | `middleware/auditLogger.js` | Persists all events to `business_events` table |
| └ Dead letter queue | `middleware/deadLetterQueue.js` | Captures handler errors to `dead_letter_queue` table |
| **Retry middleware** | `middleware/retry.js` | Exponential backoff with configurable retries |
| **InMemoryTransport** | `transports/InMemoryTransport.js` | Current production transport |
| **KafkaTransport** (placeholder) | `transports/KafkaTransport.js` | Drop-in replacement with topic config |
| **Event store** | `store/EventStore.js` | Query + replay persisted events |
| **Domain handlers** (7 modules) | `handlers/` | All major domains wired |

### Event Flow Across Modules

All 8 domains publish and subscribe to events. Key cross-module chains:

| Trigger Event | → Handler | → Downstream Event |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `sales.order.created` | Purchase: check stock → auto-PR | `purchase.pr.created` |
| `sales.order.created` | Manufacturing: check BOM → auto-MO | `manufacturing.mo.state_changed` |
| `sales.order.confirmed` | WMS: reserve stock | `wms.stock.reserved` |
| `wms.shipment.completed` | Finance: create AR + JE | `finance.ar.created` → `finance.journal.posted` |
| `purchase.goods_receipt.completed` | Finance: create AP + JE | `finance.ap.created` |
| `purchase.goods_receipt.completed` | WMS: increase stock | `wms.stock.adjusted` |
| `pos.transaction.completed` | WMS: deduct stock | `wms.stock.adjusted` |
| `pos.transaction.completed` | Finance: create AR | `finance.ar.created` |
| `pos.transaction.completed` | CRM: update loyalty points | — |
| `hr.expense.approved` | Finance: create JE | `finance.journal.posted` |
| `hr.salary.calculated` | Finance: payroll JE | `finance.journal.posted` |
| `hr.employee.onboarded` | HR: create leave entitlements | — |
| `crm.opportunity.won` | Sales: create SO draft | `sales.order.created` |
| `manufacturing.inspection.completed` | Manufacturing: update MO | `manufacturing.mo.state_changed` |
| `manufacturing.mo.state_changed` (完成) | WMS: receive finished goods | `wms.stock.adjusted` |

### Kafka Migration Checklist

When the system needs to scale beyond in-memory:

1. `npm install kafkajs`
2. Uncomment KafkaTransport client code in `transports/KafkaTransport.js`
3. In `EventBus.js`, swap: `new InMemoryTransport()` → `new KafkaTransport({ brokers: [...] })`
4. Create Kafka topics per `KAFKA_TOPIC_CONFIG` in KafkaTransport.js
5. Add retry middleware to the chain: `bus.use(retryMiddleware)` before DLQ
6. Deploy consumer instances (same handler code, Kafka consumer groups handle distribution)

**Zero handler code changes. Zero middleware changes. Zero event catalog changes.**

## Cross-Module Workflows to Complete

These are end-to-end workflows that span multiple modules. Completing them is a measure of true ERP maturity.

| # | Workflow | Current Gaps |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Procure-to-Pay** (PR → PO → GR → 3-way Match → AP → Payment → Bank Rec) | RFQ, QC, payment, bank rec steps |
| 2 | **Order-to-Cash** (Quote → SO → Credit Check → Pick → Pack → Ship → AR → Payment → Bank Rec) | Credit check, pick/pack, payment receipt, bank rec |
| 3 | **Plan-to-Produce** (Demand → MRP → MO → Shop Floor → QC → FG Receipt → Cost Variance) | MO lifecycle, shop floor, QC, cost variance |
| 4 | **Hire-to-Retire** (Recruit → Onboard → Probation → Reviews → Salary Rev → Offboard → Final Pay) | Onboarding, probation tracking, salary revision, offboarding |
| 5 | **Record-to-Report** (JE → Post → Period Close → TB → Adjustments → Financials → Audit) | Period close, adjusting entries, audit trail |
| 6 | **Lead-to-Cash** (Lead → Qualify → Opportunity → Quote → SO → Deliver → Invoice → Collect) | Lead qualification, opportunity-to-quote conversion |

---

## Testing Priorities

See [ERP_GAP_ANALYSIS.md](ERP_GAP_ANALYSIS.md) Section 11 for detailed test additions. Key priorities:

1. **Payroll calculation accuracy** — bracket boundaries, all deduction types
2. **Three-way match boundaries** — at tolerance, just over tolerance
3. **Cost layer consumption** — FIFO vs LIFO ordering
4. **MRP with multi-level BOM** — scrap rate + lead time offset
5. **POS full transaction** — scan → cart → payment → receipt → inventory deduction
6. **Cross-module flows** — Quote → SO → Ship → AR → Payment

---

---

## Technical Debt

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TypeScript migration | Currently all JSX; no type safety |
| Test coverage gaps | Many lib engines lack unit tests |
| i18n completeness | UI is zh-TW; no English fallback |
| Accessibility | No a11y audit done |
| Secret management | API keys in Dockerfile ENV — should use secret manager |
